### What's so important? ![Billy](./_static/whats_so_important.png)
_This section will contain a summary of the important things to take away from this lesson._

The image is of [Billy Crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Crystal) in the movie [The Princess Bride](https://youtu.be/O3CIXEAjcc8?si=KuAqBnSRnxifq26j). There is a scene in the movie where Miracle Max is going to bring the hero, The Dread Pirate Roberts, back to life, but before he does, he needs to find out if there is a noble cause. He finds out by filling the hero's lungs with air and shouting out, "What's so important?". It's fun! You should watch the full movie.  

Here is a short clip of the scene.  [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/7qVlNiAYshQ?si=nndqiBeEeDHqN8fu) to see the full scene.
