# Installing jGrasp

There are several reasons to use jGrasp.
1. Simple yet powerful enough for introductory college courses  
2. Supports projects, debugging, immediate execution
3. Does NOT support AI nor AutoComplete

A deep link to the jGrasp download page is here: [jGRASP Download](https://spider.eng.auburn.edu/user-cgi/grasp/grasp.pl?;dl=download_jgrasp.html)

## Option 1 (recommended):
For the most simple installation, we recommend using jGRASP's Bundled installation that includeds a supported version of the JDK.

```{admonition} NOTE
:class: note
This option will only allow you to use jGRASP, so if you plan to use development environments other than jGRASP you should follow the "Option 2" instructions below to install JDK and jGRASP separately.
```

## Option 2:
This option might lead to bothersome error messages in jGRASP, but would be preferrable if you wish to use development environments other than jGRASP. You will need to download and install two pieces of software: the Java compiler (known as the JDK) and a Java development environment called jGRASP. Follow these instructions:

1. [JDK installation](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse14x/software2-openJDK/openjdk.html)  
2. [jGRASP installation](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse14x/software2-openJDK/jgrasp.html)  

Some users already have the JDK installed on their computers because of other software that they use that is written in Java. If you think this applies to you, you can safely skip the JDK section of this guide, although you may find that you need to come back and complete it anyway.
