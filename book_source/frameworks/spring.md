# Spring

The core goals of Spring are:

* **Dependency Injection (DI):** Promotes loose coupling by managing object creation and wiring.  
* **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):** Helps separate cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transactions.  
* **Simplified Configuration:** Reduces boilerplate code via annotations and XML configuration. This helps one create *microservices*.   
* **Integration Support:** Easily integrates with other frameworks like JUnit and Mockito, making it easier for developers to write clean, maintainable, and testable code.
* **Web Development:** Spring MVC provides a powerful way to   build web applications.  
* **Security:** Spring Security offers robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.    

While Spring is mostly for Web Development, we will be focusing on functionality beneficial to a client application.
