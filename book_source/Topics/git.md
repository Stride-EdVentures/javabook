# Git

It is important to know that `git != GitHub`. 

In this topic, you will learn about both `git` and `GitHub`. 

**Git**  
You'll learn why to use git and how to use git (with an emphasis on the UI within VS Code). This lesson will cover the popular commands such as `pull` and `push`. You'll learn what a `branch` is and how to use them. This lesson will discuss merge conflicts and how to resolve them.   

**GitHub**  
This lesson will cover some of the tools that GitHub offers above and beyond `git`.  

## What is Git?
`git` is a Source Control Management tool. It offers:  

* **History Tracking**  
    * Developers want to have access to every version of a file  
    * Enables rollback to any point in time  
* **Collaboration**  
    * Enables multiple developers to change the same file at the same time  
    * Merges changes and allows humans to do conflict resolution  
* **Server-side backup**  
    * The server can be on the cloud which is backed up  

## History of git
Git does not stand for anything; it's just the name of a version control system created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the founder of Linux.
The word "git" is a British slang term, which can refer to a silly, foolish, or annoying person. 
Linus said: Git is "the stupid tool that I made because I was fed up with other systems". 
Git is: distributed, fast, powerful, reliable
Git is: complicated and console based

### Linus Torvals
> *I'm a bastard. I have absolutely no clue why people can ever think otherwise. Yet they do. People think I'm a nice guy, and the fact is that I'm a scheming, conniving bastard who doesn't care for any hurt feelings or lost hours of work, if it just results in what I consider to be a better system. And I'm not just saying that. I'm really not a very nice person. I can say "I don't care" with a straight face, and really mean it.*
