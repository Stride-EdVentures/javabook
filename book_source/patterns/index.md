This section will provide a thorough lesson on Patterns & Principles in designing software.

**Design Patterns** (like *Singleton*, *Factory*, or *Observer*) are reusable solutions to common problems within a single application or module. They're about how you structure code and objects.  

**Architecture** describes the high-level structure of an entire system. Architecture describes how different services, databases, and components interact with each other. *Microservices* is an example architecture **approach** because it defines how one organizes and deploys the overall application.
